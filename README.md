# Minesweeper Game

Hi, I made this game as a term project in my very second term at the Object Oriented Programming course (CS 102 @ Ozyegin University) Then I had to renew my github with my new e-mail and considered reuploading this project. And while at it, I noticed that some parts of this code could be improved.

So here it is, Minesweeper.java!

**Note** You can directly run the game if you have java installed and don't a .If not, please first install Java. All you have to do after installing is to compile and run. You can do these by typing in the terminal:
1. `javac -d bin src/mineSweeperGame/*.java`
2. `java -cp bin mineSweeperGame.MineSweeper`

Don't forget to get into the Minesweeper folder ;)

# Minesweeper Game

Hi, I made this game as a term project in my very second term at the Object Oriented Programming course (CS 102 @ Ozyegin University) Then I had to renew my github with my new e-mail and considered reuploading this project. And while at it, I noticed that some parts of this code could be improved.

So here it is, Minesweeper.java!

**Note** You can directly run the game from terminal if you have java installed and don't want to download an IDE. If you don't have java, kindly install it first. All you have to do after installing is to compile and run. You can do these by typing in the terminal:
1. `javac -d bin src/mineSweeperGame/*.java`
2. `java -cp bin mineSweeperGame.MineSweeper`

Don't forget to get into the Minesweeper folder before typing these ;)
